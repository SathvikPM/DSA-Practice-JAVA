# ðŸ§  DSA-Practice-Java

This is my **DSA practice repository** to build my **problem-solving ability**.  
I am following **Striverâ€™s A2Z DSA Sheet** to strengthen my DSA skills.  
I solve problems on **GeeksforGeeks** and **LeetCode**, and whatever I practice there, I add here for **revision in the future**.
